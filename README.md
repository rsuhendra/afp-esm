# Antifreeze Protein Prediction with ESM2 and LoRA (In Progress)

This repository contains an ongoing project focused on predicting antifreeze proteins (AFPs) using the ESM2 protein language model fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The goal is to leverage deep learning and protein sequence data to enhance the prediction accuracy of AFPs, which are essential for various applications, including cryopreservation and biotechnology.

## Project Overview

- **Model**: ESM2 Protein Language Model (35M version, due to Colab memory constraints)
- **Technique**: Fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for domain-specific prediction
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Objective**: Improve the identification and prediction of antifreeze proteins in sequence datasets.

## Current Status

This project is still in progress. Key milestones and results include:

- Fine-tuned the 35M version of the ESM2 model with LoRA for AFP prediction.
- Achieved an $F_1$ score of 0.8 on initial test datasets.
- Ongoing adjustments and improvements are being made to refine the model and evaluate its real-world applicability.
